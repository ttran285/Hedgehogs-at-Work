<p>The Hedgehogs at Work game is exclusively available installed in a CD that can then be used to install onto your PC. This simple process will be further explained later. When obtaining the CD, you will also receive an instructions manual and a Jewel CD case. The instructions manual will describe the game, similar to the Help file shown in this manual. The Jewel CD case will also include a title page for the game.</p>
<p> The game itself once installed will be a simple executable file that u can run. For any questions or comments, feel free to email the Happy Hedgehog Co. President at aashmikam@gmail.com <mailto:aashmikam@gmail.com>. We look forward to your statements. J For now, enjoy the game!</p>
