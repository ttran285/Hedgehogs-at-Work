<p>The Hedgehogs at Work game is exclusively available installed in a DVD  that can then be used to instal onto your PC. This simple process will be further explained later. When obtaining the DVD, you will also receive an instructions manual and a Jewel DVD case. The instructions manual will describe the game, similar to the Help file shown in this manual. The Jewel DVD case will also include a title page for the game.</p>

<p> The game itself once installed will be a simple executable file that you can run. For any questions or comments, feel free to email the Happy Hedgehog Co. President at aashmikam@gmail.com <mailto:aashmikam@gmail.com>. We look forward to your statements. For now, enjoy the game!</p>
