In Hedgehogs at Work, players can <u>print</u> both the high scores and a "Super Hedgehog Worker" certificate!

<Title>The Highscores</Title>
<b><p>
For a player to print their high scores, they just have to follow a few simple steps :) Firstly, they must go to the high scores option from the main menu. Here, they can view the high scores for all three of the levels. They can then find a print icon on the bottom left corner of the screen. By pressing this icon, they will be brought to the regular print options screen. For formatted results, we ask that the player to set the layout when printing to landscape, instead of portrait. This will print them all three highscores behind a pretty background. The player may print updated high scores later, or keep printing any other time to their heart's content.

<Title>The Certificate</Title>
<b><p>
Once a player completes Level three, they are automatically deemed a <u>Super Hedgehog</u> worker:D This is shown by the printable certificate displayed at the end. The certificate also has their name right below the hedgehog. When the player sees the ceritifacte screen, they can either continue, or press the print button. By clicking on the print button, the user is once again brought to a print properties screen. From here we once again ask the user to print in landscape rather than portrait for optimal formatting. The player can now print, and may print the certificate as many times as they like when they have reached the Super Hedgehog Worker standard.
