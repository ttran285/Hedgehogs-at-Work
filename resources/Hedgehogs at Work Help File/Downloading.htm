Upon obtaining our DVD, the user can install the software/game through this easy guide. :)
</p>
<b><u>Installing</u></b>
<p>
When the user has opened the folder for the disk drive, they will find an excecutible file called the "HedgehogsAtWorkInstaller". After double clicking this, they will be brought to an installation screen. Here they have to continue the process as the instructions will state, and must agree to our license agreement. From there it will instal to the computer (in a place the user had selected while ageeing to terms, otherwise in program files), and will create a shortcut to the desktop. The user may now open the program from the location downloaded, or the desktop and start menu shortcuts, and may play the game.
</p>
<b><u>Uninstalling</u></b>
<p>
If the user ever wishes to uninstal, all they must do is double click the unintal executable file found in the same directory as they chose to instal the program. The program will then proceed to uninstal.
